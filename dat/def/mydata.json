I initially began my coursework after finishing most of general electives and gradutating with my Associates degree from Jackson College and completed approximately two additional years of academic work at Western. During this time I was also working near to full time and while I was not failing out, I was not excelling academically in the way I had in the past, so at about a semester or two  short of graduating, I decided to take a step back from academics with the intent to resume at a later point in time and try to reaffirm my passion in this field of study.<br><br>After about three years away spent working professionally, I decided I was in a good place in life to resume my studies. I returned to Western to wrap up the eight or so courses I had outstanding in my degree program. This time around, I excelled in the way I was used to in the past, receiving all 4.0's and one 3.5 in the remainder of my coursework. Notably in my return, I found myself taking multiple graduate level computer science classes as substitutes for undergraduate credits I needed due to scheduling constraints and my working full time while pursuing the rest of the degree. Passing through these with the highest marks served to reaffirm my confidence in myself within the field of computer science and served to reaffirm my passion for it.<br><br>One of the most notable experiences in my time at Western occurred during my return period and was my last two courses and two semesters at Western before graduation. During this period, the program required all students participate in a Senior Design course, which had a strong focus on software engineering and matched senior student teams up to real, professional clients to work on a project for them. The team I was on was matched with a client from Western's Electrical and Computer Engineering department and we worked on a modernization solution for a pre-existing semi-conductor manufacturing modeling software for him.
